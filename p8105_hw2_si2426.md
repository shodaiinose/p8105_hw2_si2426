## Problem 1

``` r
transit_df = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entrance_type, entry, vending, ada) %>% mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, NO = FALSE))
```

``` r
head(transit_df, 5)
```

    ## #   and abbreviated variable names ¹​station_name, ²​station_latitude,
    ## #   ³​station_longitude

The data is not yet tidy as there are quite a few cells with missing
values. In order to minimize this, each route number and route should be
independent variables. There are 684 distinct stations. 468 of the
stations are ADA compliant. The proportion of entrances/exits without
vending that allow entrance is 0.38.

``` r
transit_df_reformat = transit_df %>% mutate(route8 = as.character(route8), route9 = as.character(route9), route10 = as.character(route10), route11 = as.character(route11)) %>% pivot_longer(route1:route11, names_to = "route_number", values_to = "route_name")
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. Of the stations
that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

### Mr. Trash Wheel

``` r
mr_trash_df = read_excel("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = cell_cols(c("A:N"))) %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% drop_na(dumpster) %>% mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) %>% mutate(dumpster = as.numeric(dumpster)) %>% mutate(type = "mr") %>% mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

We have cleaned the original data by altering some of the variables,
removing rows that do not include dumpster-specific data, and rounding
the number of sports balls collected. We have also added a `type`
variable to indicate that the data belongs to Mr. Trash Wheel.

``` r
head(mr_trash_df, 5)
```

### Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
prof_trash_df = read_excel("./data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = cell_cols(c("A:M"))) %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% drop_na(dumpster) %>% mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(NA)) %>% mutate(type = "professor") %>% relocate(sports_balls, .before = homes_powered)
```

We have cleaned the original data by altering some of the variables,
removing rows that do not include dumpster-specific data, and adding a
variable `sports_balls` to count the number of sports balls collected
(this has been filled with missing values as the data has been removed
in the updated data file). We have also added a `type` variable to
indicate that the data belongs to Professor Trash Wheel.

``` r
head(prof_trash_df, 5)

### Combined Dataset

``` r
combined_trash_df = bind_rows(mr_trash_df, prof_trash_df)
```

We have combined the Mr. Trash Wheel and Professor Trash Wheel datasets
to create a single tidy dataset.

``` r
head(combined_trash_df, 5)
```

    ## #   ¹​volume_cubic_yards, ²​plastic_bottles, ³​polystyrene

The combined dataset contains 641 observations across both Mr. and
Professor Trash Wheel. The key variables include the dumpster number,
date of collection, weight of total litter per dumpster, and various
types of litter collected. The types of litter include the following:
plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, glass bottles, grocery
bags, chip bags, and sport balls. A variable specifying if a dumpster
was Mr. Trash Wheel or Professor Trash Wheel has also been included to
distinguish between the two types. The total weight of trash collected
by Professor Trash Wheel was 190.12 kg. The total number of sports balls
collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 was 856 balls.

## Problem 3

### National Politicians

``` r
pols_month_df = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% separate(col = mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% mutate(month = factor(month.name[(as.numeric(month))], levels = month.name)) %>% mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% mutate(president = ifelse(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop")) %>% select(-c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day)) %>% arrange(year, month)
```

We cleaned the dataset by separating the `mon` variable into `year`,
`month`, and `day` variables. We mutated the `month` variable so that it
becomes a factor variable with levels based on the month name. We also
made the `year` variable into a numeric variable. A new `president`
variable was added to specify which party the president belonged to at
the time. Variables that were no longer needed were removed. Finally,
the data was arranged by year and month order.

It must be noted that there are several days in which the `prez_gop`
variable takes a value of 2 which is larger than 1, as shown in the
tibble below. These values occur between August 15, 1974 and December
15, 1974. This is possibly due to President Gerald Ford’s oath of
office, which occurred on August 9, 1974, as a result of President
Richard Nixon’s resignation.[^1]

``` r
read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% filter(prez_gop > 1 | prez_dem > 1)
```

### Standard & Poor’s Stock Market Index

``` r
snp_df = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% separate(col = date, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% mutate(month = factor(month.name[(as.numeric(month))], levels = month.name)) %>% mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% select(-c(day)) %>% arrange(year, month)
```

First, we coerced the `date` variable to a date object type. We cleaned
the dataset by separating the `date` variable into `year`, `month`, and
`day` variables. We mutated the `month` variable so that it becomes a
factor variable with levels based on the month name. We also made the
`year` variable into a numeric variable. Variables that were no longer
needed were removed. Finally, the data was arranged by year and month
order.

``` r
head(snp_df, 5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 3
    ##    year month    close
    ##   <dbl> <fct>    <dbl>
    ## 1  1969 January  103. 
    ## 2  1969 February  98.1
    ## 3  1969 March    102. 
    ## 4  1969 April    104. 
    ## 5  1969 May      103.

Unemployment

``` r
unemployment_df = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% pivot_longer(jan:dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment_rate") %>% mutate(month = str_to_sentence(month)) %>% mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb, labels = month.name)) %>% arrange(year, month)
```

First, we cleaned the variable names. As the dataset was not tidy, we
used `pivot_longer()` to create a row for each month, year observation.
We mutated the `month` variable in two ways. First, we made the month
abbrevation start with a capital letter as it was previously in lower
case. Next, we coerced the month to a factor variable by month
abbreviation, which we relabeled to the full month name. Finally, the
data was arranged by year and month order.

``` r
head(unemployment_df, 5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 3
    ##    year month    unemployment_rate
    ##   <dbl> <fct>                <dbl>
